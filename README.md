Hi, I'm Perry. ðŸ‘‹ I run the Netlify support forums. I've been with Netlify since September 2018. Prior to that, I ran a code school, worked in student services, was a frontend developer, a project manager, and a buncha other tasks. :) I am a second generation technologist (my mother was a computer programmer who started in 1969). I currently live in Portland, Oregon and am originally from Europe.

I use he/him or they/them pronouns


### What are your primary goals as a human being?

* I aim to facilitate growth and learning in myself and in others. I see opportunity easily, and want to support those trying to reach their full potential
* I care deeply about equality supporting women, POC, LGBTQ people in tech and in life. Social causes & justice are important to me
* I am passionate about understanding things deeply and seeing connection between things that often gets overlooked. I have a research mind.
* I am naturally driven toward improvement.
* I want you to feel good about yourself and about our work.
* Everybody is valid, everybody is important!
* I like joy. Life is short.

## Communication Style:
* I am fairly direct, honest, don't beat around the bush much, fairly literal, but always strive to be friendly and kind.
* You have a green light to DM me at any time. If i am available, i will respond. If i am not, I won't, but i will ever hold it against you.
* Letting me know something is time sensitive is helpful. So are reminders that I promised to do something!
* that said - please do not tag me in the forums with a mention. I get many of those and am unlikely to see it. Emails are not my first option for communication, DM me instead.
* I laugh â€“ a lot! Loudly. I invite you to join me and relax a little. I'm not very formal.
* I am very flexible. Let me know what communication style works well for you, or if there is something I can do to put you at ease and enable your best work.
* Please be forthright and quick to ask questions if something is unclear or confusing. I want you to have clarity. I will not judge your question-asking one bit. Ever.
* I try and be as authentic and generous as I can â€“ when I like your work, you will know. When we have something difficult to discuss, I will seek to give you Actionable, Specific, Kind feedback. If I fail to do so, you have a green light to let me know.
* Mistakes and dropped balls have not yet been the end of the world.
* I want to hear your real opinion. Donâ€™t sugarcoat it, but also donâ€™t worst case scenario it. Neither is helpful.
* Done is better than perfect. There is always room to iterate.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
* I have low face recognition. Sometimes it is hard for me to recognize faces or people out of context. I might meet you at a conf but not recognize you at a bar, for example.
* I grew up in England and Germany, which still influences how I think and communicate. Some US cultural references may not resonate with me as much.
* I have been described as a bit intimidating â€“ something I try and temper with humor and warmth. Join me in a joke!
* I am very much a non-binary gendered person with traits traditionally associated with both men and women. I'm not very gender conforming in any direction.
* I am also an ambivert - neither an intro nor an extrovert. I like to be very social and outgoing, and also to be very quiet and do my own thing.

## How can you best work with me?
* Let's be timely & connect as humans for 1-2 minutes before we launch into work stuff when we meet! I want to know how you are!
* Let's be clear when things are brainstorming and when they are concrete plans
* I might not have thought things through if put on the spot. I will often return to things once i've mulled things over and understood the complexity of an issue.
* Know that I am more of a big picture thinker than focused on minutae. I can be very detail oriented, but it is not necessarily my natural state. I will always be thinking about the larger context though - that is my natural state.

## A few life mottos
* Better a strong No than a weak Yes.
* Feelings aren't facts. And facts aren't feelings. Both are important, but not always equally important for a given context.
* I try to best to maximize the amount of work I don't have to do.

## What are your pet peeves?
* Rudeness, dismissiveness is challenging for me
* Being presented with decisions as opposed to being involved in decisions
* Inefficiency, especially combined with an unwillingness to see or hear my or
others ideas for improvement.
* Needing to always be right. Letâ€™s focus on the bigger picture instead!
* Disorganization, lack of clarity, mess â€“ both figurative and literal, i find it stressful and overwhelming.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
* I can be a bit hasty and donâ€™t always plan super well. On the flipside I'm very flexible.
* I can be a bit loud and punchy sometimes, especially in the grey area between work and play.
* I can sometimes be a bit rigid with my thinking and tend towards throwing the baby out with the bathwater. -> I am working on taking a breath and allowing more time for process.
* I am quite wordy. This isnâ€™t always helpful. For me it takes more time & effort to write something short than something long
* I can be impatient, brusque. I may interrupt. I sometimes give un-asked-for advice (aka splaining, sorry in advance). 

All of those traits are "under active development". The best way to help me stop doing them (or something I haven't identified) is to let me know how these things impact you negatively.

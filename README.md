### What are your primary goals as a human being?

* I aim to facilitate growth and learning in myself and in others. I see opportunity easily, and want to support those trying to reach their full potential
* I care deeply about equality supporting women, POC, LGBTQ people in tech and in life. Social causes & justice are important to me
* I am passionate about understanding things deeply and seeing connection between things that often gets overlooked. I have a research mind.
* I am naturally driven toward improvement.
* I want you to feel good about yourself and about our work.
* Everybody is valid, everybody is important!
* I like joy. Life is short.

## Communication Style:
* Until we know each other well, I won't feel confident until if I don't receive positive feedback and encouragement regularly. Once I know that, it becomes less necessary and I take more risks.
* I am fairly direct, honest, don't beat around the bush much, fairly literal, but always strive to be friendly and kind.
* I laugh – a lot! Loudly. I invite you to join me and relax a little. I'm not very formal.
* I tend to be wordy, verbose, long winded, and write long emails. Blargh!
* I try and be as authentic and generous as I can – when I like your work, you will know. When we have something difficult to discuss, I will seek to give you Actionable, Specific, Kind feedback.
* Mistakes and dropped balls are rarely the end of the world
* I want to hear your real opinion. Don’t sugarcoat it, but also don’t worst case scenario it. Neither is helpful.
* Done is better than perfect.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
* I have low face recognition. Sometimes it is hard for me to recognize faces or people out of context. I might meet you at a conf but not recognize you at a bar, for example.
* I grew up in England and Germany, which still influences how I think and communicate. Some US cultural references may not resonate with me as much.
* I have been described as intimidating – something I try and temper with humor and warmth. Join me in a joke!
* I am very much a non-binary gendered person with strong masculine/male traits and also strong feminine/female traits. I am also an ambivert - neither an intro nor an extrovert.

## How can you best work with me?
* Let's be timely & connect as humans for 1-2 minutes before we launch into work stuff when we meet! I want to know how you are!
* Let's be clear when things are brainstorming and when they are concrete plans
* I might not have thought things through if put on the spot. It's great if there is openness for me to return to questions later once i've mulled things over and understood the complexity of an issue.
* I need to take notes during meetings, and may ask you to repeat things or explain them again. I am trying to process both what you are saying and its implications
* Tell me when I did a good job! I will tell you because I'm excited to praise you!

## What are your pet peeves?
* Rudeness, dismissiveness is challenging for, yes.
* Being presented with decisions as opposed to being involved in decisions
* Inefficiency, especially combined with an unwillingness to see or hear my or
others ideas for improvement.
* Flakiness, consistently being inconsistent. I can tell the
difference between this and an evolving process.
* Dogmatic thinking, a resistance to reason and a reasonable conversation.
* Needing to always be right. Let’s focus on the bigger picture instead!
* Disorganization, lack of clarity, mess – both figurative and literal. I find disorganization stressful and overwhelming.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
* Sometimes a harsh word or rude gesture has sticking power and it can take a while for me move on.
* I can be a bit hasty and don’t always plan super well. On the flipside I'm very flexible.
* I can be a bit loud and punchy sometimes, especially in the grey area between work and play.
* I can sometimes be a bit rigid with my thinking and tend towards throwing the baby out with the bathwater. -> I am working on taking a breath and allowing more time for process.
* I am quite wordy. This isn’t always helpful. For me it takes more time & effort to write something short than something long
* I can be impatient, brusque. I sometimes give un-asked-for advice (aka splaining, sorry in advance)
